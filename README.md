# Advent of Code

Advent of Code 2019 solutions, written in Kotlin.  The code is not particularly clean overall.  I used this as a learning experience for Kotlin.  Also, the code has not been cleaned up much, if at all, once the solution for a given day has been achieved.  In some cases, the part 1 solution was modified in place for part 2 and so a file may print solutions to both parts 1 and 2, or just to part 2.
