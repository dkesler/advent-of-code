# Advent of Code

Advent of Code solutions for 2019 and 2020, written in Kotlin.  The code is not particularly clean overall.  The 2019 version was used as a learning experience for Kotlin.  Additionally, I prioritized speed of solve (in a not very effective effort to get on a leaderboard) rather than cleanliness or readability, and once the solution had been achieved, the code was not cleaned up much, if at all.  In some cases, the part 1 solution was modified in place for part 2 and so a file may print solutions to both parts 1 and 2, or just to part 2.
